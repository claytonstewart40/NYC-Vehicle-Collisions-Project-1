Intro/Q1 analysis: (David G)
“What are the top ten most dangerous Streets?”
For our project we chose to look at vehicle collision data in New York City. We found a data set that gave details as well as causes for accidents over a 3 year period.  First we decided that it would be interesting to see what street of New York was the most crashed on. As seen in the bar chart the top three “streets'' with the most crashes were all on highways or expressways. Specifically, Belt Parkway contributes to the most accidents at 3905 over 3 years. With Broadway and FDR Drive following very closely behind the top 3. This gave me the idea that there could be a connection between the density of traffic to the number of accidents. Thus, I began to play around with the idea of sorting the number of accidents by zip code to give me a better representation of accidents in an area rather than a very specific street. The top 5 ZipCodes related to population are: 11368 in Queens, 11226 in Brooklyn, 11373 in Elmhurst, 11385 in Ridgewood, and 10467 in the Bronx. The overall highest accident prone zip code was 11207 in Brooklyn totalling just over 7000 crashes over 3 years in that area. Many of the most accident prone zipcodes are near the top 3 most crashed on streets. For example Belt Parkway runs through or near a majority of the southern highlighted zip codes.

Q2 analysis: (Paul S)
“What vehicle is most likely to be involved in crashes?”

In this portion of our project, we present an analysis of car accidents in New York City 
The objective of the analysis is to gain insights into the types of 
vehicles most likely to be involved in car accidents and their associated
contributing factors.

The analysis revealed that sedans are the most common type of vehicle involved in car accidents in New York city, 
followed by SUVs. The top contributing factor for both vehicle types was "driver inattention/distraction", then "following too closely"
and "failure to yield right of way". SUVs were more likely to be involved in an accident due to backing up unsafely than sedans.  

To further inform the public, we used the data to visualize what day of the week these two vehicles were most likely
to get into an accident and found that Friday was the most dangerous. 
However, pedestrians are more likely to be injured or killed on the weekend, specifically on Sundays. We can assume 
that this is due to more pedestrians on the streets. In the future, we'd like to confirm with a seperate dataset 
that there is a direct correlation between number of pedestrians on the streets and accidents. 

Q3 analysis: (Clayton S.)
“What is the most likely time of day to get into an accident?”
 
During 2021 to September 2023, the most likely time of day to get into an accident in New York City was between 16:00-16:59 or 4-4:59pm.  The pie chart demonstrates the fluctuations in the amount of crashes throughout the 24 hour period in chronological order.  
Contrary to what I had first thought, the late hours in the evening had some of the lowest distributions of accidents.  My thinking was that since more people are out drinking, one is more likely to get into an accident.  Although it could still be true (dependent upon further research), that one is more likely to get into an accident *with a drunk driver* during those times, it was far more likely in NYC to get into an accident during the early to mid rush hour times, as well as the 2pm-2:59pm slot, which came in third, and is technically not rush hour.  
The least likely time to get into an accident was from 3:00-3:59am.  This leads me to believe that the more vehicles are on the road, the more likely it was for there to be an accident.  I think this because, traffic is heaviest during rush hour times, and the very least during the late hours of the night, which in my experience, there has been the fewest amount of cars on the road.  
We dug more and wanted to find out which days of the week had the most accidents. This ended up being Fridays. Most of the days were very similar however, about 299,000, and Friday was the most at 324,113.  Sunday had the least crashes at 243738.
If we were to expound further into crash data, it would be interesting to find the correlation coefficient between number of cars on the road and number of accidents.  Unfortunately, number of cars on the road was not in this dataset, but it may be possible to find for future research endeavors.
